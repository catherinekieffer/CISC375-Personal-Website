                    My final project for my Artificial Intelligence class was setting up a robot that could write letters and then words using those letters.
                    My group and I had to not only make sure that the robot was able to move well, but we also had to work on the code sent to the robot. The robot
                    used some principles of AI to have the robot follow this path.

                    One of my favorite projects was being able to combine my love for music with my computer science knowledge!
                    In my Creative Coding class I was able to create an extremely interactive porject. I used a midi to hook up 
                    my laptop with my keyboard and then based on the notes I pressed on my keyboard, different colors and shapes
                    would appear on my screen. This picture is me performing a particular piece for my teacher. Incorporating the
                    visual, physcial playing piano, and the listening.

                    Another project I worked on in my Artificial Intelligence class was a tictactoe game that you could play against 
                    the computer! My partner and I used the principle of heuristics and the minimax algorithm to create an AI that was 
                    capable of playing tictactoe against us. In this picture you can see some of the min nodes and their heuristic values
                    which is how the computer chooses the "best" choice for itself. This project was really interesting as it helped me 
                    understand how AI knows what the "best" option is!

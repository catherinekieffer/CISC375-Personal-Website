    <h3> Hi! Welcome to Catherine's personal website!!</h3>

                <p> 
                    My name is Catherine Kieffer and I am a current senior studying Computer Science at the University of St. Thomas!
                    I am also minoring in Catholic Studies as it gives me a chance to dive into my faith!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love being in school, but I am excited to find a job after college, hopefully doing something in the software engineering
                    world or maybe even a project manager! Although I really like to code, my extraverted personality makes it hard for me 
                    to sit for long periods of time staring at a computer so I am hoping to find a job with a lot of teamwork and communcation!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am the second youngest of six and I love to spend time with my family. I'm hoping that after college I will be able 
                    to spend more time with my siblings and my 10 nieces and nephews!
                </p>
